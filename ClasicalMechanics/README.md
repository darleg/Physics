Classical mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the motion of objects and the forces acting on them. It is based on principles that were formulated primarily by Isaac Newton in the 17th century and remains fundamental for understanding how objects behave in our everyday world. Here are some of the key concepts and principles in classical mechanics:

Key Concepts
1. Newton's Laws of Motion:
- First Law (Law of Inertia): An object will remain at rest or move in a straight line at 
  a constant speed unless acted upon by a net external force.
- Second Law (Law of Acceleration): The acceleration of an object is directly proportional 
  to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass ($𝐹=𝑚⋅𝑎$).
- Third Law (Action and Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite 
  reaction.
2. Kinematics: The study of the motion of objects without considering the forces that 
  cause the motion. It involves concepts like displacement, velocity, and acceleration.
3. Dynamics: The study of the forces and torques that cause motion. It encompasses the 
   application of Newton's laws to understand how objects move.
4. Energy:
- Kinetic Energy: The energy of motion, given by $𝐾𝐸 = \frac{1}{2}𝑚𝑣^2$.
- Potential Energy: The energy stored in an object due to its position or configuration, 
  such as gravitational potential energy ($𝑃𝐸=𝑚𝑔ℎ$).

5. Work: Work is done when a force acts on an object to move it over a distance. It is 
   calculated as 
𝑊
=
𝐹
⋅
𝑑
⋅
cos
⁡
(
𝜃
)
, where 
𝜃
 is the angle between the force and the direction of movement.

6. Momentum: The product of an object's mass and velocity (
𝑝
=
𝑚
⋅
𝑣
). Conservation of momentum is a key principle, meaning that the total momentum in a closed 
system remains constant if no external forces act on it.

7. Rotational Motion: Describes the motion of objects that rotate around an axis. It involves concepts like angular velocity, angular acceleration, and torque.

8. Harmonic Motion: Motion that repeats itself, like the oscillation of a pendulum or a 
   spring. It is characterized by periodic motion and can be described using sine and 
   cosine functions.
