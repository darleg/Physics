# Physics
Physics is a fascinating and broad field that seeks to understand the fundamental principles governing the universe. It covers a wide range of topics, from the tiniest subatomic particles to the vast expanse of the cosmos. Here are some key areas within physics:

1. Classical Mechanics: The study of motion and forces on macroscopic objects, including
   concepts like Newton's Laws of Motion, energy, and momentum.
2. Electromagnetism: The study of electric and magnetic fields and their interactions with
   matter, which includes understanding circuits, Maxwell's equations, and electromagnetic waves.
4. Thermodynamics: The study of heat, energy, and the relationships between them, encompassing laws of thermodynamics, entropy, and thermal properties of matter.
5. Quantum Mechanics: The study of the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic levels, focusing on wave-particle duality, uncertainty principle, and quantum states.
6. Relativity: The study of the structure of space and time, developed by Einstein, which includes Special Relativity (dealing with objects moving at constant speeds) and General Relativity (dealing with gravity and acceleration).
7. Optics: The study of light, its properties, and its interactions with matter, including reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference.
8. Nuclear Physics: The study of the components and behavior of atomic nuclei, including nuclear reactions, radioactive decay, and applications like nuclear energy.
9. Astrophysics: The study of the physical properties and behavior of celestial objects and phenomena, including stars, galaxies, black holes, and the Big Bang.
